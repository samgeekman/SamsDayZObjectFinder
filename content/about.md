**A tool made by SamGeekMan to help DayZ modders and server owners find the objects they need.** 

Designed to be used with the [DayZ Editor](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2250764298) and other modding tools.

> As of September 2025 it includes all rocks, trees, bushes, clutter and a few other objects. More are added every day - see the [Discord changelog](https://discord.com/channels/1414751279548203008/1414751374394261534).

**How to use**

Browse by category and search for specifics. 

Many items feature search tags and allow you to combine them to create useful searches like

> `green backpack`


> `small yellow tree`

You can also filter for console compatible objects.

**Errors and suggestions**

There will be errors in spelling and taxonomy - but all this was done by hand! If you notice something then let me know.
